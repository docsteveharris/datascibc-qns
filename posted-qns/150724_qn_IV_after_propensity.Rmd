I am trying to replicate the methods used in [this paper](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1883020) by Paul Rosenbaum and colleagues (Near-Far matching). I have been studying the methods in the [referenced papers](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~mbaiocch/Near%20Far%20Matching.pdf) by Michael Baoicchi.

My work examines the (binary) outcome (dead/alive) a treatment where there is a 'health system' discouragement that acts as the instrument. The treatment is usually selected for the sickest patients, and I am hoping that the 'discouragement' instrument will allow me to evaluate the outcome without selection bias.

I have posted a sample data set [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docsteveharris/datascibc-qns/master/posted-data/150728_qn.csv) and the code to [github](https://github.com/docsteveharris/datascibc-qns/blob/master/posted-qns/so_q_150724.R)

I have replicated the matching steps, and now have a balanced discouraged group and an encouraged group. 

    Summary of balance for matched data:
             Means Treated Means Control SD Control Std. Mean Diff. eCDF Med eCDF Mean eCDF Max
    distance        0.2998        0.2996     0.0347          0.0051   0.0055    0.0047   0.0330
    age            70.1648       70.3901    16.3334         -0.0133   0.0110    0.0148   0.0495
    male            0.4945        0.5165     0.5011         -0.0438   0.0110    0.0110   0.0220
    illness        16.2363       16.1978     7.7234          0.0050   0.0110    0.0123   0.0604

I can see that there appears to be an effect of discouragement on both the treatment and the outcome.

    > with(mdt.match, table(treat, discourage)) # treatment is 'discouraged'
         discourage
    treat   0   1
        0 132 140
        1  50  42
    > with(mdt.match, table(dead, discourage))  # mortality is lower when discouraged
        discourage
    dead   0   1
       0 106 120
       1  76  62

What I can't get calculate is the effect ratio, and its confidence interval. Can anyone point me a walk-through, or offer some simple guidance.
